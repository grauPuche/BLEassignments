# week 4: Noble and Bleno

I keep playing with the potientiometer as it uses analog readings and variety is much higher. 

This time I made the value of the potentiomenter, read from the arduino, to be shown constaly in terminal using noble. This part was rather simple.

I tried to turn it arround somehow using bleno and week4_potCheck.js but I wasn't as fortunate as before. If you see what I was doing wrong I would appreciate the input.
