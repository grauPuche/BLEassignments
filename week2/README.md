# week 2: BLE Light Sensor

It is a simple read of light values through a LSR that sends is send via BLE as a notification.

It is an adaptation of the temperature sensor. but instead of changing the values to temperature I used a scale of 0 to 100 to make it simpler and avoid fluctuation on light that are not equivalent to a noticeable change in light.
